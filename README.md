## Abstract
This study presents a method to improve feature-based machine learning models in materials science by leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs) as featurizers. Our approach combines traditional chemical and geometrical features with GNN-derived descriptors, offering both interpretability and enhanced accuracy. Three independent techniques for GNN featurizer construction were employed:  
- Compressing electronic structure descriptors  
- Integrating pretrained GNN models  
- Task-specific GNN development

Using MODNet as the base feature-based model and MEGNet for GNN featurization, the proposed method yielded significant accuracy improvements, particularly for predicting the heat of formation in perovskites, reducing the error by up to 44.2% compared to default MODNet settings.

This approach was further generalized to more complex tasks such as convex hull distance and band gap prediction using halogen-containing materials from the OQMD dataset. SHAP plots and surrogate models were utilized to restore interpretability of the GNN features, extracting valuable chemical insights.
