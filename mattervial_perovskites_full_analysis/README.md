Each of the results presented in the paper comparing the performance of MatterVial featurizers and the addition of adjacent coGN is contained in the `mattervial_perovskites_mattervial*` folders.
The output data for the coGN and hiSISSO features enhanced models is in the `output_coGN_enhanced/` and `output_hiSISSO_enhanced/` folder.
The SISSO results that lead to the hiSISSO model and the formulas used to enhance the model are shown in the `SISSO_analysis/` folder.
