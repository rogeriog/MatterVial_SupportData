# Results of the encoders and SI of the main paper.

These are the results of the previous version of the paper, the package was named pGNN since we had not implemented the full interpretability framework and the results were mostly centered around the perovskite dataset without full evaluation in MatBench and the expansion to all other featurizers.

The previous version of the paper is provided for easier reference to the analysis provided in this folder.
